### Ethical Implications

Our project was building a note-taking application called Notey.
When building such an app, there are ethical and professional 
responsibilities that come with it. Some of the ethical
responsibilities we have include ensuring transparency with the users.
When users create an account with Notey, we ask them to enter
personal information such as email, name, and passwords. With this personal data in our hands
we must establish clear communication with users to ensure them about how we handle 
their data. This leads to another ethical responsibility we have which includes 
ensuring user data privacy. The app must be able to safeguard user data, so it is 
not manipulated by unwanted sources.

Some of the professional responsibilities we have as engineers include providing upmost
improvement to our application. In addition, it is our responsibility to develop an application
that is at the highest level of quality. Engineers like us should ensure that the application
is correctly functional with no bugs. Finally, we are professionally in charge of user data security. 

A global impact of this note-taking app is global connectivity. This app bridges people from various
locations, allowing them to share and connect notes.

An economic impact of this note-taking app is the app can provide an
alternative method into the world of note-taking, replacing the standard 
paper method of note-taking. In general, this app opens up a new market for 
educators to create and share their notes.

An environmental impact of our note-taking app is reduction of paper consumption. 
As this app is digital, fewer trees will have to be cut down reducing the overall carbon 
footprint.

A societal impact that this note-taking app has is the promotion of communication. 
It allows various people (educators, students, workers) to share their ideas in a new collaborative way.
